# NSUT-Feedback-Flask-Application
This is a Flask Application for students of NSUT. 
They can add their feedback about NSUT facilities, techers, infrastructure and much more by using their university Roll numbers. 
The students can also see various links for respective webpages of NSUT like the NSUT IMS login page, NSUT notices and circular page, Nsut Home page, etc.
They can also see a list of details of the the person to contact for any query. 
The email address and phone numbers with the respective authority are also provided in this application to help students.
